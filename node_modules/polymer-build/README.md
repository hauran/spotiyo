# polymer-tools
These are build tools used by
[generator-literate-polymer](https://github.com/Custom-Elements/generator-literate-polymer).

No real reason to use these stand alone, but in a nutshell, this is a
fork of vulcanize that has been modified to do transform pipelines for
less and browserify, allowing you to vulcanize elements with more than
just `.css` and `.js`.
